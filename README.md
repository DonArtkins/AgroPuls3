## Design Prompts for Galileo.ai
1. **Homepage**: Modern farming tech hero scene: farmer using tablet with drone and AI graphs overlay. Vibrant green/yellow gradients. Grid of 4 course cards with hover effects.
2. **About**: Split layout: left-team collage with diverse faces, right-mission text over soil texture. Testimonial carousel with farmer quotes.
3. **Services**: 3D grid of interactive course cards (AI, drones, sensors). Each card has icon, short video preview, and 'Start Learning' button.
4. **Blog**: Masonry grid with blog cards: thumbnail, title, tags (AI, Sustainability). Featured post with full-width video embed.
5. **Contact**: Futuristic split screen: left-AI chatbot bubble, right-minimal contact form. Background: abstract farm field with circuit lines.

## Color Scheme
* **Primary**: `#3A8C3E` (Earth Green)
* **Secondary**: `#6C4DDA` (Tech Purple)
* **Accent**: `#FFD700` (Sunflower Yellow)
* **Neutral**: `#F5F5F5` (Light Gray) + `#2D2D2D` (Dark Slate)

## Fonts
* Headings: **Space Grotesk** (tech vibe)
* Body: **Inter** (clean readability)

## Setup
1. Clone this repo.
2. Replace `images/` with your visuals.
3. Customize `style.css` for branding.
4. Deploy!

## Image Suggestions
* **Heroes**: Farmers using tablets/drones, AI data dashboards, glowing soil sensors.
* **Icons**: Pixel-art tech icons (robots, drones, seeds).
* **Blog**: Before/after farm transformations, infographics on AI benefits.

## Next Steps
* Use Galileo.ai to generate visuals with the prompts above.
* Add JavaScript for:
   * **Chatbot**: Basic AI responses (e.g., FAQ).
   * **Course Progress Tracker**: LocalStorage for user progress.
